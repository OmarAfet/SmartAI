# SmartAI

SmartAI is a place where creativity thrives. We are a team of creators and dedicated researchers aiming to use artificial intelligence to enhance people's lives.

## DoctorGPT

DoctorGPT is our first application. It's similar to ChatGPT but in Arabic, designed for evaluating and diagnosing patients. The artificial intelligence asks appropriate questions to understand the individual's condition and provides advice, visual representation, or sends the patient's information for AI-based diagnosis.

We have several goals for DoctorGPT, including:

- Converting text to illustrative images and vice versa.
- Detecting if symptoms are unusual and providing alerts to seek medical attention.
- Interpreting lab test results in understandable language for patients.
- Discussing medications and diagnoses with patients for their benefit.
- Sending medication reminders through notifications.

We hope to integrate our application with health platforms to serve patients of all age groups.
